# Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Python Remake

## Description:

This project is a terminal-based implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, designed for quick and easy gameplay from the command line. The game detects winning combinations (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) or a tie if their are no more open spaces left. The game has clear prompts and updates after each turn. 

## Key Features:
### The prompts include but are not limited to:

- Allowing users to choose who they would like to play with - a robot or a friend (human). 

- Allowing the first player to choose their icon - x or o. 

### The updates include but are not limited to: 

- Display available spaces on the board and select a corresponding number  

- Announcing a winner or declaring a tie. 

- A restart prompt when the game ends. 

## Technologies Used:

- **_Python_**
- **_Git for version control_**
- **_Visual Studio Code as my IDE_**

## Challenges and Learnings:

Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges such as successfully ending the game loop and updating existing values (i.e. lists and board display). By overcoming these hurdles, I gained valuable insights into troubleshooting techniques and best practices in terminal-based Python game development.

## Future Iterations:

I will be expanding this project by refining existing features. Future iterations may include integrating Database Management. I will also be implimenting a GUI in a different repository.
